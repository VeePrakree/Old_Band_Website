# The Erasers Webpage!

This is an old website that I made in HTML and CSS for the Beatles cover band that I was in, named the Erasers. 
Index.html links to the home page, contact.html to the contact slide, and styles.css provides the styling. 

The url of the website is [theerasersband.com](http://www.theerasersband.com/).
